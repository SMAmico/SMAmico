# FinalCS1 | Function Grapher | COMPLETE FOR NOW

## Project Parts

-this is a program that can graph  up to 4 simple functions, save custom window sizes, and more.
-for proper installations, download the main .java file, the dependencies folder, and the .net folder. 
-Windowsave.java is optional, the program will recreate a new one upon execution.
-place all three objects together in a location for proper use. 
-ANSI color use is minimal, having it enabled or disabled will not significantly alter the result.
-the program uses a character matrix to graph the result of a function, and displays it in the console, with varying window sizes written to an external file. 
some of it is rather messy, due to multiple io overhauls/optimizations.
-this program uses the exp4j library, with more info being in the FinalsCs1.java file.
-tip- when selecting a window size save, try inputting 'never_gonna' . it may have some strange effects down the line!(nothing murderous, that's the last repo push)
-a second tip- the program may not like larger functions on large windows, as stated before, some of it is spaghetti code.
have fun with this tiny nubbin!
